As a avid gamer, I have always been and continue to be inspired by the thought of contributing in the gaming
industry that will create a positive impact in the society. While electronic games has not always been viewed 
in a positive way in our society, I feel gaming has so much to offer in our society. It has so much potential 
used in medical industry to treat mental illness like depression, Bipolar disorder etc to schools, universities 
to help them better engage with the concept of learning and many other applications.

Thus, after carefully reviewing Kingsisle work culture and passion for games, I feel that my technical background,
work experiences and passion for game is a perfect match which will help both of us go far in the gaming industry
and create some of the best gaming experience for the users, while creating a positive impact in the lives of 
people all over the world.
