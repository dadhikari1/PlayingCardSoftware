Hello Everybody, 

First of all, I want to thank you so much for giving me an opportunity to showcase my technical 
knowledge to create a meaningful software. I have created a software that primarily demosntrates OOP 
concept to create reuasable code and demonstrate my knowledge on development of enterprise level software
development principles. I've also used Dictionary to store the cards as the value while a integer generated
as random number as key to those values.

Plus I want to give props to the recruiting team for desiging such a unique assessement experience, I've been
involved in hundred's of interviews, assessement which can be tedious, time consuming while some being meaningless.
But this process of showcasing knowledge to develop a meaningful software was one of the best assessement I've 
ever taken.
